Oh hello!

I'm Hannah. I'm a developer, a theater person, an older sister, a New Yorker (but also a Jersey Girl), and so much more!

**In re: tech -** I'm a full stack developer, but with a strong interest on the front end. I love learning new things and working with others. I especially enjoy working on user-facing products and features, but I am always open to contributing deeper down in the stack when I can.

**In re: theater -** I'm an actor/singer/dancer and also a stage manager. I usually (but not always!) end up playing the funny roles. Some favorite roles: Little Sally (*Urinetown*), Little Red (*Into the Woods*), Trinculo (*The Tempest*).

**In re: background -** I was born in NYC, but grew up in northern NJ. I got interested in technology at about age 12, when I read a book called "So You Want to Build A Website" in the middle school library during lunch. At the same time, I became heavily involved in all aspects of theater. I pursued these weirdly orthogonal interests all through high school and college - even to the point where I majored in Computer Science, but minored in Theater. After college, I worked in professional theater for 4 years, both in NYC and also touring the country with the awesome [Missoula Children's Theatre](http://mctinc.org/). Then I took a slight(?) change of direction and started working at [Adaptly](http://adaptly.com/) in 2014.

**In re: likes -** Dogs, especially [my dog Groot](https://www.instagram.com/grootdog/), cheese, learning new things, music, spending time with my family and friends, coffee, fun earrings, the smell of lavender.

**In re: dislikes -** Ants, humidity, trying to sleep with a stuffy nose.
