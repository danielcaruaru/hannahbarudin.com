# My new and improved site
YAY Jekyll.

I am not a designer, so thanks to **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** for making everything look pretty. Their [Setup Guide](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/) is really good.

## Notes to Self
All featured images should be in a height-to-width ratio of precisely 1 x 2.927 to display consistently.
